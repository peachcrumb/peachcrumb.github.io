# Project: Dear Wendy

## Overview 
*The problem:* There are currently multiple email updates from President Hensel that flood our hawaii.edu inbox every week. With every government update and the fast pace of the landscapes for American universities (like ours), it would be nice to receive a consolidated newsletter from Wendy regarding her statements and plans to address upcoming issues and dispel potential concerns about the future of UH.

*The solution:* To reduce our inbox clutter and give FOMO victims some peace of mind, the Dear Wendy page will have all of the President's updates in one place. It will be a blogpost-style site and include a form where users can submit their own questions for Wendy.
