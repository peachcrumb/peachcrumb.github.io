# Project: Dear Wendy

## Overview 
*The problem:* There are currently multiple email updates from President Hensel that flood our hawaii.edu inbox every week. With every government update and the fast pace of the landscapes for American universities (like ours), it would be nice to receive a consolidated newsletter from Wendy regarding her statements and plans to address upcoming issues and dispel potential concerns about the future of UH.

*The solution:* To reduce our inbox clutter and give FOMO victims some peace of mind, the Dear Wendy page will have all of the President's updates in one place. It will be a blogpost-style site and include a form where users can submit their own questions for Wendy.

## Names of the proposers
Phoebe Chang


## Mockup page ideas
Some mockup pages include:

- Main newsfeed
- Ask Wendy form submission page
- Individual posts pages
- Contact information page
- About/FAQ page
- Wendy's login page


## Use case ideas
Whether or not the following bullet points list all pages or not, the completed use case should show an end-to-end scenario of using the system.

- User goes to landing page (newsfeed), to Ask Wendy form and submits, gets homepage to view existing posts.
- Wendy/admin goes to landing page/Wendy login, logs in, sees new messages from form, reponds to messages/post replies, gets home page.
- Wendy/admin goes to landing page/Wendy login, logs in, edits site posts/pages.

## Beyond the basics
After implementing the basic functionality, here are ideas for more advanced features:

- Share feature for individual posts to social media/email/etc.
