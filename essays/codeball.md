Typescript definitely isn’t one of my favorite languages, but it isn’t terrible either. Javascript happened to already be one of my weaker ones due to having minimal experience, but for some reason I wasn’t expecting Typescript to be this closely linked to Javascript.  

ES6 was kind of a nightmare at first for the informal or take-home WODs since I wasn’t really used to it.  

Once I learned (and continue learning) more precise syntactical features, it will probably become a smoother ride.  

## Learning as a sport?

Athletic software engineering is a very amusing and interesting way to describe what is likely an industry standard.  

That being said, I can understand how the comparisons are a decently accurate representation of the methods and mindsets needed to succeed as a programmer.  

# I like WOD-dle dee...

I like the WODS even though I always barely finish or end up somewhere outside of the average zone, especially because the idea and even the practice WOD scared me at first  

(am I becoming an adrenaline junkie in my old quarter-century age?). They’re less stressful other than the overall workload, because having frequent due dates throughout the week is definitely a weak point for me since I’ve never been really good with time management.  

Still learning, though! I’m not sure if there’s any reason for the WODs not to be good practice, at the very worst it "not working" for me would be if I DNF.  

I’d be curious to look more into its pedagogy and see how effective this type of learning is or isn’t.  

Did not use AI in assignment.
