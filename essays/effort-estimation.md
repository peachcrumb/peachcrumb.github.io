## Guesstimation Novices

Our initial estimations of how long each task would take were made using half-hour increments. We guessed by the context of the individual branch responsibilities and chose the increments based on how long we presumed our attention spans would hold out, and so the issues would depend on our half-hour blocks without a break and however many it took to complete each one.

## Possible Benefit of Estimations

I can't speak on behalf of the rest of the group for this one, but unfortunately I only considered the benefit of having estimations ahead of time after completing the work. I did not end up using the given estimates to block out my schedule and set aside specific hours of the day to work on the project. It definitely could've helped me be more organized and intentional with my time. However, the only portion of the guesstimated time I used for my own benefit was the half-hour increments for monitoring myself and just how long I can work without needing to stop. 

## Effort Tracking is Arduous for Novices like me

I wouldn't say I directly benefitted from effort tracking, but it seemed like something harmless to focus maginally extra on and was interesting to compare the results after the tasks were completed. The added minimal entertainment value was welcome, as observing the weights of each type of effort is something that had been discussed in another course I was taking. 

## Checking Myself and Avoiding the Wreck of Bugs

It's always normal in measured scientific experiments to have some sort of standard deviation from human error, but I honestly don't have any other ideas of how I could've made my exact timing more accurate. To track my work, I would glance at the clock before and after a period of working, log how much time had passed, and start/stop again. The half-hour blocks proved to be helpful and mostly relative, as there were only a couple times in the entire project that I was able to sit for over an hour consecutively and work for the entire duration.

## No Roadblocks from Estimating and Tracking

From the examples above we see both the smart and not-so-bright ways to pose a question. We can conclude that including as much relevant information as possible and exhausting all other available resources before asking are the best strategies to get much closer to the answer one is looking for (rather than a vague or largely unhelpful one). In recent years and perhaps at times throughout the overall history of the internet, we've seen hyperspecific moments (like the commenters for both of these questions) where other users are generous and willing to respond regardless of the level of intelligence or thought input into the question. However, it cannot always be expected that people will be courteous online, and therefore we should do our best in serious forums to ask efficient questions so as not to waste our or everyone else's time and possibly avoid discomforting or hostile conversations.
