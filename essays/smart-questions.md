## There are stupid questions

If you ever heard a teacher excitedly spouting about there being no stupid questions, either they had extremely little real-world experience (doubtful), or just said that to encourage class participation. Questions that can sometimes be considered "stupid" are found throughout numerous areas in life. Let’s examine some specific examples and see how they can be improved or avoided.

## Reform your question and increase answerability

In life, when it comes to using the command-line to execute your statements or change the shell (something the [forums guide](http://www.catb.org/esr/faqs/smart-questions.html#idm568) specified not to ask!), StackExchange and likely one of its many sites in the family will have the answer for specific enough questions. The following question was found on the Apple Ask Different page since it was specifically regarding shells in Terminal. See how [this question](https://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/334542/zsh-vs-bash-shell-in-terminal) is missing pieces and clearly needs improvement:

```
Q: Zsh vs Bash shell in Terminal  

Are there any advantages to using zsh vs bash shell in Terminal app? Also, can you use zsh from the terminal? My understanding of zsh is skewed.
```

And if there isn’t time to check the link to the question itself, note that it was a duplicate or already existing question within the forum site (lending to its stupidity factor… may I say stfw). This question is bare-bones at best, given that it is missing:  
1) Evidence of attempting to answer their own questions
2) Specifications of what they need exactly
3) Background information on what they already know – in this case they only provide "My understanding of zsh is skewed"... Great! Give us nothing to work with, why don't you!?!

It also contains a yes/no type of question within the post, which can be considered unnecessary. Thankfully, a couple of people were gracious and answered the silly question with the following: 

```
Q: Are there any advantages to using zsh vs bash?
A: Both have their own unique set of features. It's upto you to choose a shell. Bash is the default login shell set for users in macOS whereas zsh is also available.

Q: can you use zsh from the terminal?
A: Yes. Simply type zsh in Terminal to start Zsh shell. You can also set zsh as your default shell by going to System Preferences app → Users & Groups right click on your account name and choose Advanced Options....

Choice of shell is a subjective matter. However, if you are a command line newbie, it's recommended to stick with Bash shell.
```
 
The answers were detailed and civil, and the one referenced above even included an image for reference. Next time, this poster should utilize Google first before creating a duplicate question, and figure out if they need to largely narrow what they are looking for before or as they draft their post.

## How to avoid asking a stupid question

While there are decent questions that benefit everyone, there are those one can ask to create an entirely different effect. In the following example, a user asks how he would, in short, create a desktop application with Facebook.

```
Q: Facebook Desktop Notifier

I am a beginner programmer that have never used anything other than what's included in a language.

I am trying to create a desktop application that notifies me anytime I get an update onfacebook. 
How should go about doing this? Thanks in advance.

edit Sorry I was not clear. Is there any way to make a DESKTOP application with facebook?
```

A simple “yes” would have answered the question, but we know that’s not the sort of answer he or she is looking for. Fortunately, someone kindly responded with a link to Facebook’s developer website. The asker should have done more research on his or her potential project. Then further down the road, he or she could have asked more specific and detailed questions that wouldn’t require a thousand-paged response for a sufficient answer.

## Conclusion

When we rely on others’ generosity and expertise to provide answers to our questions, it should hold that the question we ask should be one that leads to efficient and effective help that not only benefits us, but also the people we ask and others who might ask the same question in the future. Thus, if you have a question… make it a smart one! Asking questions may not always get you the best answer, but asking them in a way that will make others want to answer them will increase the success of finding a good solution and make it a positive experience on all sides.
