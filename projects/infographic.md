For CHEM 162, we were assigned final projects where we could choose from an approved list of topics. Using online resources tp create an infographic about Subjective Cognitive Decline (SCD) was an appealing route for me due to family members falling victim to dementia. I wish I'd been aware of the information I found when they were first diagnosed because the statistics indicate its commonality, and I would've felt slightly less burdened or isolated in the struggle to care for them. The full resource also mentions treatment/support options for those affected (not exclusive to diagnosed patients). See more below:
