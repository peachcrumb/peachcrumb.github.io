## Overview

</div>

We built this site to help students and companies find each other through its portal, with companies selecting their ideal candidates based on ideal skills and students searching for companies by filtering to match their interests based on those in their student profiles.


## Phoebeâ€™s Role

Some of my contributions to building the program were initial versions of the admin login pages; including the student and company lists, new student and company forms, and early models and objects in the Prisma Schema database file. I also surveyed community members to garner their feedback after testing our project.
