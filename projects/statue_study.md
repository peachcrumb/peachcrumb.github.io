During the 'tools' module of ARCH 100, we were instructed to observe the Bumpei Akaji statue in front of the RISE building, and capture a  reference image while being able to explain our intentions behind the angle we chose. This was an individual project and did not contain a proposal or drafting step before being submitted. Its intention was to teach us how to become more detail-oriented and comfortable with sketching our designs, for practice as well as inspiration in future assignments. Above are both my reference image (left) and final product (right). I chose this specific view for the reference because I thought it best-showcased the overall statue, with its U-shaped line and loop, and directions from the ground to up and outward clearly on display.  

In this study, I was able to experience via observation how light hits dark surfaces to cast shadows at a specific time of day (the reference image was taken at ~11:00am in late September). Using this knowledge, I determined how I would use the following specific mediums: black and dark brown ballpoint pens, black thin-tipped sharpie, mechanical pencil (I think 0.5mm lead), 2B and 4B pencils, standard elementary-set black color pencil, and pink copic marker (for the Atherton building background) to emphasize which panels or 'faces' of the sculpture were lit up and which visually receded with shadows. I did have some difficulty maintaining the integrity of each columnn or arm's proportions, since I am not a sketch or visual artist by trade.
