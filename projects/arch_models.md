These models were part of the second large project set in ARCH 101. The 3D figures originated from a previous project set of shape studies on vellum paper. The models in this set were to be within imaginary boundaries of a 10" cube, and consist of at least 12 different volumes, preferably of different dimensions but as 1 shape. That shape could either be 3 or 4-sided when drawn, but would need to total to 6 sides or faces. All the volumes needed to be connected to at least one other volume within the confines, and there could not be more than 1 body of touching volumes (cannot have 2 or more 'islands' of shape clumps). This was an individual project and mostly self-directed other than the occasional comments from the professors or TAs. 

Throughout this project, I learned how to use specific crafting tools like the straight edge (itâ€™s more of a triangular prism) for scaling, varying between different sizes of Xacto and other cutting products, and how to effectively apply adhesives for moments throughout the models that would appear to defy gravity. The intention of the project was to get us familiar with craftsmanship and expectations, teach us how to effectively manage time, and encourage us to explore all possibilities we could fit within a given timeframe for how our structures could develop or transform to evolve as a concept. Between the three models, each one was to be made of a specific material: chipboard (left), 1/8" basswood sticks (center), and a hybrid of (right) the chipboard, sticks, and cardboard. For my specific rotation of shapes, I interpolated both 3 and 4-sided shapes into each of the models. They are all slight variations of eachother with the given medium requirement for each step.
